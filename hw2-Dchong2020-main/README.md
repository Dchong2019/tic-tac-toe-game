## COT 4930 - Full Stack Web Development

the player is defaulted to x and the computer is o. 

for the npc i created a simple bot that just fills in a random element within the grid.
because the bot selection is random, it is very easy to win against the bot. 
when the players xusor is over a valid move box it will turn green indicating that a sikgn can be placed in then box.
if there is a;ready a sign in the highlighted box then the box will turn red indicating that the player cannot place a sign there.

once the game is over it will take you to a result screen that shows the outcome ofthe previuos game. i also added a replay button incase the player wants to re do the game.
